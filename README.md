##A fully functional project written in detecting tomato leaf disease

This project has been built along with yolov8m - cls model by contrast of application in helping farmers and industrialization of the agricultural sector. Combine using flutter library and computer vision model, using websocket as a bridge to reduce burden for low devices is a big advantage.
